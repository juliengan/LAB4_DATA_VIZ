- create a virtual env : dz_env, and activate it on the shell

-> on windows : dz_env\Scripts\activate
-> on Linux : source dz_env/bin/activate
-> start a shell fron frontend directory and 'npm install' and 'npm run start'

- streamlit run second_app.py

********PROBLEMS*******

1) There is the bi directional component in comment 
that we see at the top of the app, it works but disables the rest of the app to display (WebServor error)

2) Another problem i issued was the fact that the expanders are printed twice 
for each option when i started logging the execution time of 
the associated functions. Consequence is I can't remember which file 
is required...
